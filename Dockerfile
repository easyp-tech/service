# Pinned to the machine doing the building, not to the image being built. The
# release builds linux/amd64 and linux/arm64, and without this the arm64 pass
# runs the whole Go toolchain under QEMU — the compiler, not just the output.
# CGO is off, so cross-compiling is a matter of two environment variables and
# the emulator is pure cost.

# when nothing is requested, so a plain `docker build` is unaffected.
ARG TARGETOS
ARG TARGETARCH

# The release passes the tag; a plain `docker build` gets "dev". Without this
# the binary has no idea what it is: every log line and every trace reported
# version "dev", so the only way to tell which build was running was to read the
# image label from outside the container.

# Dependencies are their own layer, so editing source does not re-download them.
# go.sum has to travel with go.mod or the download runs unverified.
#
# api/ and sdk/ are separate modules that the root module reaches through
# `replace` directives pointing into the working tree. Those directories do not
# exist yet at this point in the build — `COPY . .` comes later — and a replace
# aimed at a missing directory fails the download outright. Copying the two
# manifests first keeps the dependency layer cacheable and satisfies them.
