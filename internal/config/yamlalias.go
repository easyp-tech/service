const pairStride = 2

// yamlAliases maps a config key's former name to its current one, for keys that
// were renamed rather than removed.
//
// It is empty, and that is the point of adding it now.
//
// An unrecognised YAML key refuses the start — a good contract, and the right
// one for a service whose settings are spelled three ways (snake_case here,
// UPPER_SNAKE in the environment, camelCase in the chart). But it means a
// rename is a hard failure for every deployment still carrying the old name,
// with no window in between. Before 1.0 that is a bad afternoon; after 1.0,
// when the configuration surface is frozen, it is a major version.
//
// So the migration path has to exist before the rename that needs it. With this
// table a rename costs one entry: the old key keeps working, its value goes
// where the new name expects it, and the operator gets a warning naming both
// and the line to change. One release later the entry moves to retiredKeys and
// the old name stops working — deliberately, and after having said so.
//
// This is not where removals go. A key with no replacement, or one whose
// replacement takes a different shape — license.public_key became a map keyed
// by key id — cannot be migrated by renaming it, and belongs in retiredKeys
// where it produces an explanation instead of a silent misreading.
//
// Both paths must share a parent: this renames a key in place and does not move
// a value between sections. TestYAMLAliasesRenameInPlace enforces that, so an
// entry that would need a move fails the build rather than being applied
// halfway.

// applyYAMLAliases rewrites former key names in the parsed document to their
// current ones, and reports each rewrite as a warning.
//
// It runs on the node tree, before the document is decoded and before it is
// checked against the schema, so everything downstream sees only current names:
// the decode fills the right field, and the unknown-key check does not report a
// name this table just accepted.
